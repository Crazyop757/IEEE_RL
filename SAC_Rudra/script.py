CODE ANALYSIS SUMMARY
=====================

1. Q_Learning_v7.py:
   - Implements tabular Q-Learning with epsilon-greedy exploration
   - State space: 20 discrete stress levels (total_surplus/total_deficit)
   - Action space: 15 discrete bidding strategies (alpha1, alpha2 coefficients)
   - Uses separate Q-tables per microgrid type (IND, COM, SD, CAMP)
   - Reward: (Price difference Ã— energy) - CHP costs
   - Hyperparameters: learning_rate=0.8, discount=0.5, epsilon=0.2
   - Iterations: 4500 episodes per decision

2. code_v7.py:
   - Energy simulation module for 8 microgrids
   - 4 functions: industry(), community(), singleD(), campus()
   - Manages ESS/EV charging based on price preferences (p_c, p_d)
   - Uses linear programming for CHP optimization
   - Returns: deficit, surplus, updated ESS/EV status

3. main_v7.py:
   - Main orchestration loop (24 time slots = 1 day)
   - Reads energy data from CSV
   - Calls Q-Learning for each MG to determine bid/ask prices
   - Calculates MG stress and bid/ask prices based on Q-Learning output
   - Writes results to bidAsk_v7.csv

4. settings1.py & settings2.py:
   - settings1: Defines action space Y1, Y2 (alpha coefficients)
   - settings2: Gets Market Clearing Price (MCP) from user input

KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS FOR SAC:
=====================================
- Need to replace discrete action selection with continuous policy
- State representation must include: ESS/EV levels, prices, loads, PV, time, stress
- Action: Continuous bid/ask price adjustments OR ESS/EV charging rates
- Reward: Negative total cost (grid purchase + unmet demand - revenue from sales)
- Environment: Custom Gym environment wrapping code_v7 functions
